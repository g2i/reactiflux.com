[4:40 PM] aspit:Yes! I was 19 when I got my first programming job -- I cold emailed a startup telling them I liked what they did and would love to intern for them (paid). That turned into a full-time job a few months later. Get involved in the community. Build a portfolio. Don't rely super hard on online job apps - as a hiring manager you often get hundreds of applicants.
[4:40 PM] Gabe:great advice ^
@mic0
[Q&A] Arrow functions or normal functions?
[4:40 PM] aspit:arrow! I'm an ðŸ‘µ and was writing JS before ES6 though ðŸ™‚
[4:41 PM] 0.5Xer:[Q&A] Hi, Iâ€™ve been using React from around version 0.13, so have a massed a lot of components, can you recommend a way to manage and maintain these for use in multiple projects?
[4:41 PM] Elsewhere:[Q&A] If you had to say, what are a few of the largest drawbacks to something like AWS Amplify?
[4:41 PM] Aleksey Kozin:@aspit what your opinion on Redux? )
@ball_gladder
Q. What would you recommend someone learn who has a good understanding of react. What would you ask them learn next, i.e next steps?
[4:41 PM] aspit:Ooh a testing framework, how to build component libraries/design systems, maybe data viz -- but it depends on their interests and what they know outside of React

[4:42 PM] aspit:Build your own component library!

[4:42 PM] BTM:Take a look at https://nx.dev/ ðŸ™‚
[4:43 PM] Lucas:Q. What are the "perfect" projects for young developers to have in their portfolio to get the job?
[4:43 PM] Austin:[Q&A]
If i can't ask a second question please disregard this. I've noticed you've mentioned in your blog profile you're into code art? any starter recommendations? i'd love a new creative outlet. (also have you seen react three fiber? looks crazy cool)
[4:44 PM] lazyb:Do you think amplify will add support for users to login using a web3 wallet e.g MetaMask?
@Elsewhere
[Q&A] If you had to say, what are a few of the largest drawbacks to something like AWS Amplify?
[4:44 PM] aspit:Before this week I would have said the ability to color outside the lines, but we launched CDK integration this week so that's solved! It's an opinionated framework which has a lot of pros, but some cons as well. Build times can take a while, we're working on that but that's one drawback. Also, it's built for frontend/mobile developers, so if you don't fit inside that persona there are other options that may be better.
@Aleksey Kozin
@aspit what your opinion on Redux? )
[4:45 PM] aspit:Used Redux for many years! It's amazing, but I would definitely read articles about why you may not need it first. Now a days there are so many other tools
@Lucas
Q. What are the "perfect" projects for young developers to have in their portfolio to get the job?
[4:46 PM] aspit:I like games -- they require a lot of logic. Also complex UIs like shopping carts, table filters, etc. Make yourself do something full stack so you can show that you'll be able to communicate with devs on the other side of the stack.
@Austin

[4:47 PM] aspit:SO COOL -- I love P5 to start out with, it's really user friendly. I've also done fun interactive stuff for things like offline pages for sites. Always fun.
@lazyb
Do you think amplify will add support for users to login using a web3 wallet e.g MetaMask?
[4:47 PM] aspit:Forwarding on that request to the product team ðŸ™‚
[4:47 PM] BTM:Floor is open for some more questions ðŸ™‚
[4:47 PM] Aleksey Kozin:What is the biggest issue of modern web development?
[4:48 PM] kliff:Q. What to expect the first month as a junior dev?
[4:48 PM] Slayer:Q. What is your favorite text editor?
@Slayer
Q. What is your favorite text editor?
[4:49 PM] aspit:VS Code! I've been using it for like 5 years at this point, way longer than any other one I've used
[4:49 PM] Silviu:I'm a 2 year VueJs dev that started learning React recently. Do you think it's hard to grasp React coming from other frameworks?
@kliff
Q. What to expect the first month as a junior dev?
[4:50 PM] aspit:First, get your computer setup with a dev environment! Then ask your manager for a low hanging fruit ticket. They should give you something early on that will help you learn the code base, but isn't too far outside your comfort zone. Then on to maybe a larger issue ðŸ™‚
@Aleksey Kozin
What is the biggest issue of modern web development?
[4:51 PM] aspit:I think pushing the limits of the web. Apps like Figma are doing this with WASM -- there's no way you could build that with normal JS and have it be useable. I'm excited to see what more companies can do in that realm. Building really cool things that are still performant
[4:51 PM] BTM:We'll be closing the Q&A shortly so now's your chance to sneak in some last minute questions! ðŸ™‚
[4:52 PM] Aky:[Q&A] Do you think decentralised systems, like decentralised graph database GUN (https://github.com/amark/gun), have potential to replace Cloud in the future with rise of Web3?
[4:52 PM] Jonny:Q. Does working on a one-man project actually harm your coding skills? (given there are no code reviews and the scope is a lot smaller than it would be in a
real business application)
@Silviu
I'm a 2 year VueJs dev that started learning React recently. Do you think it's hard to grasp React coming from other frameworks?
[4:52 PM] aspit:Yes! A ton of the knowledge from one converts from one to the other. The first is always the hardest.
@Jonny
Q. Does working on a one-man project actually harm your coding skills? (given there are no code reviews and the scope is a lot smaller than it would be in a real business application)
[4:53 PM] aspit:It goes both ways -- I was a one-woman team for parts of my career and it allows you to do everything which is a challenge you don't get in large teams/companies. But yeah it's more difficult to learn/get reviews. I think a balance of both is really good and if you are the only person at a company make sure you're getting involved in the community/have mentors.
[4:54 PM] ZeeshanKazi:Key points to read a tech document timely and build something on it.
[4:54 PM] kliff:Q. What are some examples of junior dev "Task" how much should you know for the position?
@Aky
[Q&A] Do you think decentralised systems, like decentralised graph database GUN (https://github.com/amark/gun), have potential to replace Cloud in the future with rise of Web3?
[4:54 PM] aspit:My former boss Nader Dabit is really into the web3 space. I think it's cool, but there are a lot of issues to resolve.
[4:54 PM] mic0:[Q&A] An extension to my last question: What is the best way to get "good" clients as a freelancer? Thanks for your questions, they are incredibly helpful. Take care and stay safe everyone
[4:55 PM] Bete:What tips can you give for a junior react developer? ðŸ™‚
[4:55 PM] BTM:We'll be closing the Q&A in 5; waiting for the last question aaaand closing the gates ðŸ™‚
[4:55 PM] MichaelCuneo:Can you see the possible issues with pure JS and â€˜pushing the limits of webâ€™ solved with something like SvelteKit?
@kliff
Q. What are some examples of junior dev "Task" how much should you know for the position?
[4:57 PM] aspit:I would say at first, well scoped issues, fixing bugs that are constrained to a small part of an app, features with clear definitions.
@mic0

[4:58 PM] aspit:Build a brand. Be known as The Person for a small thing. If you have that reputation people are more likely to already trust you on that topic!
@Bete
What tips can you give for a junior react developer? ðŸ™‚
[4:58 PM] aspit:Oh similar to the ones above for jr developers generally, but keep learning. Don't silo yourself to just React, don't build your career on one technology. go beyond that!
