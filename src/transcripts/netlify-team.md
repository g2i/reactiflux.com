[4:29 PM] jlengstorf:we're seeing some usage, including internally at Netlify. it's still fairly light and a lot of what we're seeing is experiemental or proof-of-concept, but it seems like a really exciting space to watch!
@Deleted User
[Q&A] getting started with web dev freelancing, any tips?
[4:29 PM] cassidoo:Keep increasing your rates until you find a sweet spot!
@BaluBabu
[Q&A] I'm curious about JAMStack what is it?
[4:29 PM] philhawksworth:Jamstack is an approach to web development that focusses a lot on decoupling the UI from the backend. Pre-generating the front end and then serving it as static resources makes hosting, deploying, scaling sites a lot simpler than it once was. I like this summary here: https://jamstack.org/glossary/jamstack/
Jamstack.org
Jamstack | Jamstack
What is Jamstack? A way of thinking about how to build for the web. The UI is compiled, the frontend is decoupled, and data is pulled in as needed.
@juniornjay
[q&a] What is good DX at Netlify ?
[4:31 PM] jlengstorf:good developer experience is making great decisions by default on behalf of developers, but not removing any of their autonomy to reach into the config and customize things if needed

I've written about this in a longer format, too! https://www.jason.af/progressive-disclosure-of-complexity
[4:31 PM] Oli:[Q&A] Do you foresee launching any more backend services like Identity? I think they‚Äôre great! Think this got skipped?
@jd
[q&a] @cassidoo How do you manage your time and the motivation to produce so much content?
[4:31 PM] cassidoo:A strict calendar and a todo list are really important for me, and I write down a lot in Obsidian! A lot of projects can be demotivating (I have many unfinished ones lol) but if you keep working at them, you'll get a lot done üòÖ
@Oli
[Q&A] Do you foresee launching any more backend services like Identity? I think they‚Äôre great! Think this got skipped?
[4:32 PM] philhawksworth:I gotcha, Oli! https://discord.com/channels/102860784329052160/193117606629081089/885619877770068030
@Fouad
@cassidoo Rust seems to be becoming more and more popular. With the ability to use it in the browser via wasm, do you think it is a useful language to start learning for frontend development?
[4:32 PM] cassidoo:I'm at the "I don't know" phase for this language right now. I know a lot people are loving its speed for frontend stuff, but I haven't tried it myself!
[4:33 PM] Deleted User:[Q&A] Linux or MacOS which you guys prefer?
[4:33 PM] BaluBabu:[Q&A] Do you think Elixir,Go is a good next step for a competant Nodejs developer for backend dev, or is anything anything else ?
[4:34 PM] syncerax:[Q&A][jamstack] Does the (headless) CMS have anything to do with the framework used to build the actual frontend? Ex. Can I use Ghost (which uses Ember.js) as my CMS and create a frontend using Gatsby?
@Deleted User
[Q&A] Linux or MacOS which you guys prefer?
[4:34 PM] cassidoo:screams in Windows
Honestly for web dev, it's kind of all the same at this point. Do what you prefer! I use mostly Windows and MacOS.
[4:34 PM] BaluBabu:[Q&A] Do you think the whole micro-frontend approach will get more attention and be used more ?
[4:34 PM] vjr2nd:[Q& AI looked around the Web but couldn't find the React micro example to understand the core functionality of react. any suggestion? new to React.
@Deleted User
[Q&A] Linux or MacOS which you guys prefer?
[4:34 PM] philhawksworth:I'm a MacOS bod these days. But had many happy years in Linuxland
[4:35 PM] juniornjay:[q&a] Who is maintaining the Gotrue Api at Netlify ?
[4:35 PM] Oli:[Q&A] Thoughts on Redwood js?
[4:35 PM] Gabe:please hold
@BaluBabu
[Q&A] Do you think Elixir,Go is a good next step for a competant Nodejs developer for backend dev, or is anything anything else ?
[4:35 PM] cassidoo:Yes! I've been seeing a lot of companies move more and more towards Elixir and Go üôÇ
@syncerax
[Q&A][jamstack] Does the (headless) CMS have anything to do with the framework used to build the actual frontend? Ex. Can I use Ghost (which uses Ember.js) as my CMS and create a frontend using Gatsby?
[4:36 PM] cassidoo:The whole concept of "headless" means you can use anything with anything! So yes, use those to your heart's content ‚ù§Ô∏è
@juniornjay
[q&a] Who is maintaining the Gotrue Api at Netlify ?
[4:36 PM] jlengstorf:one of our internal engineering teams maintains it, but we're a little understaffed right now so active dev is on hold. we're hoping to get more folks hired soon so we can pick it up in earnest!
@vjr2nd
[Q& AI looked around the Web but couldn't find the React micro example to understand the core functionality of react. any suggestion? new to React.
[4:36 PM] cassidoo:I have an online course for it if you don't mind the shameless plug, at cass.run/rrc, otherwise I recommend going through the docs!
@BaluBabu
[Q&A] Do you think the whole micro-frontend approach will get more attention and be used more ?
[4:36 PM] philhawksworth:I do! We see big companies and projects adopting this sort of architecture quite often, and being very pleased with the agility and portability it brings them
[4:37 PM] Swift:[Q&A] What developer enviroment do you mostly use on windows cassidoo
like docker or something like laragon?
@BaluBabu
[Q&A] Do you think the whole micro-frontend approach will get more attention and be used more ?
[4:37 PM] cassidoo:All of these buzzwords get their 15 minutes of fame and bits and pieces of it end up being used a lot, lol, so... yes and no üòÖ
[4:38 PM] claudiu:What advice you give to someone without experience in any company and who is self-taught for the last 2 years? Most of the companies want people with experience
[4:38 PM] Arkadiusz:In your opinion Is IT certification relevant or should people not bother and focus on projects / writing / other thing that show their skills / insights?
@Oli
[Q&A] Thoughts on Redwood js?
[4:38 PM] cassidoo:It seems cool! I haven't built with it yet but they're doing a lot of interesting things it seems like. Plus they give away free stickers on their website, which totally won me over.
[4:38 PM] Deleted User:[Q&A] what happened to Netlify Stories? üòÇ
@Swift
[Q&A] What developer enviroment do you mostly use on windows cassidoo like docker or something like laragon?
[4:39 PM] cassidoo:Nah I don't do any of that, since I'm mostly on frontend doing serverless style development, I don't really need Docker or anything! I use the Netlify CLI but that's about it.
@Deleted User
[Q&A] what happened to Netlify Stories? üòÇ
[4:39 PM] jlengstorf:some ideas are too powerful to live
@claudiu
What advice you give to someone without experience in any company and who is self-taught for the last 2 years? Most of the companies want people with experience
[4:40 PM] cassidoo:Apply EVERYWHERE. Truly, it's a numbers game. Literally apply to more than 5-10 jobs a day. Get your foot in the door! A lot of these places don't hire you not because of you, but because of other outside things.
[4:40 PM] juniornjay:[q&a] Do you guys work with backend stuff on top of your frontend role ?
@Arkadiusz
In your opinion Is IT certification relevant or should people not bother and focus on projects / writing / other thing that show their skills / insights?
[4:40 PM] cassidoo:Meh I haven't seen it asked for much at companies, it's more of a "nice to have" than a requirement. I'd personally focus on projects.
@juniornjay
[q&a] Do you guys work with backend stuff on top of your frontend role ?
[4:41 PM] cassidoo:Sometimes, mostly in the form of serverless stuff though on my end. I left the backend life long ago üòÜ
@Arkadiusz
In your opinion Is IT certification relevant or should people not bother and focus on projects / writing / other thing that show their skills / insights?
[4:41 PM] philhawksworth:Sorry to be the first to use the phrase... but I think this is a classic for "it depends"! üôÇ
Depending on the sector you want to work in, or employers you are targeting, you might find it more or less valuable. I don't think that they should be sought "by default" without identifying a need for a specific knowledge and accreditation.
@juniornjay
[q&a] Do you guys work with backend stuff on top of your frontend role ?
[4:41 PM] jlengstorf:sometimes! I mostly find myself using tools like Hasura more than I'm building true backends, but I spend a LOT of time writing serverless functions üòÑ
[4:41 PM] kanerva:What can you NOT do when going serverless?
[4:41 PM] gregoirevda:Do you provide a CI step to extract all graphQL queries at build time to validate them against the schema ? üòÖ I‚Äôm looking for a solution to that
[4:41 PM] IanVS:[Q&A] what is the most unique or interesting serverless function you've ever seen?
@kanerva
What can you NOT do when going serverless?
[4:42 PM] cassidoo:rub your belly and tap your head at the same time, so difficult
[4:42 PM] Jamie:Do you think Hasura could be used for a highly scalable production app?
@kanerva
What can you NOT do when going serverless?
[4:42 PM] jlengstorf:streaming chunked responses won't currently work, and stuff like subscriptions / WebSocket connections don't work
@gregoirevda
Do you provide a CI step to extract all graphQL queries at build time to validate them against the schema ? üòÖ I‚Äôm looking for a solution to that
[4:42 PM] cassidoo:You could do this with a Netlify Build Plugin, in theory!
https://www.netlify.com/products/build/plugins/
[4:42 PM] Centrax:[Q&A] I was just hired as a junior developer but I work alone and no one to really bounce ideas off which is the only bad thing about the job. I have had to do a lot of learning recently and picked up the MERN stack. Was there any other stacks that you can think of to build internal web apps that is beginner friendly?
@Jamie
Do you think Hasura could be used for a highly scalable production app?
[4:42 PM] jlengstorf:absolutely! it's in production for quite a few companies at large scale now
[4:43 PM] Gabe:3 more q's please
@juniornjay
[q&a] Do you guys work with backend stuff on top of your frontend role ?
[4:43 PM] philhawksworth:I think the boundaries are blurring more and more! I find myself at "the back of the front end" a lot, plumbing together systems with front-ends. It's one of the joys of so much decoupling in the architecture these days for me!
[4:43 PM] OrnithopTyler:[Q&A] What's your most controversial linting rule opinion? (a la .eslintrc)
@OrnithopTyler
[Q&A] What's your most controversial linting rule opinion? (a la .eslintrc)
[4:43 PM] cassidoo:Linting should be dusted out and never used again
(I don't actually believe this, it just sounds controversial)
[4:43 PM] Arkadiusz:If you were to say what kind of advantage Netlify has over Heroku?
@cassidoo
Apply EVERYWHERE. Truly, it's a numbers game. Literally apply to more than 5-10 jobs a day. Get your foot in the door! A lot of these places don't hire you not because of you, but because of other outside things.
[4:43 PM] claudiu:I was in a situation with 2 companies, on one company I've done the web assessment in React and move to the technical interview and after technical interview they call me and said "You was very close and you've done very well but the only reason we choose someone else was because he had more experience than you. And the second company I had 3 interviews and after they called me to say they don't have any project for me because they need people with experience :(. This 2 processes was during one month and after I was for a day really disappointed
[4:44 PM] Jimothy:[Q&A] Whenever I‚Äôm coding and hit the M key, it registers as an N and vise versa. How do I fix this?
@Jimothy
[Q&A] Whenever I‚Äôm coding and hit the M key, it registers as an N and vise versa. How do I fix this?
[4:44 PM] cassidoo:Reprogram your keyboard
@cassidoo
Reprogram your keyboard
[4:44 PM] Jimothy:Thank you very much.
[4:44 PM] syncerax:[Q&A][career][Netlify] How relevant is learning about security for web developers (especially in the context of Jamstack)?
There are so many different security implications to consider while deploying a website. It's quite overwhelming!
Is there any way Netlify helps here?
@claudiu

This 2 processes was during one month and after I was for a day really disappointed
[4:45 PM] cassidoo:Ugh yeah, that's so frustrating. That's why I really emphasize to apply all over the place. You truly never know what'll happen.
@IanVS
[Q&A] what is the most unique or interesting serverless function you've ever seen?
[4:45 PM] philhawksworth:So many possibilities! I had a ball recently using serverless functions to generate, store, and render custom conference lanyards for Jamstack Conf. .... cue a picture of me as a cowboy...
https://jamstackconf.com/badge/SZ5oRHd4lwtF
[4:46 PM] jlengstorf:that's why I shave mine! if it makes you self-conscious, go for it! but definitely don't feel like you need to
[4:46 PM] juniornjay:[q&a] Any advice for non US devs looking for remote roles ?

[4:46 PM] cassidoo:I think it's good to know as much as you can, but what I like about building on Netlify in a very serverless, decoupled way is that I can pull in something like Auth0 or Okta or Stytch and get all the security without having to implement it myself üòÜ
@cassidoo
Ugh yeah, that's so frustrating. That's why I really emphasize to apply all over the place. You truly never know what'll happen.
[4:46 PM] claudiu:I've stared from today to post on linkedin all the progress which I'm doing everyday when I'm working on my projects and I will try probably to post on youtube the be more exposed
@Haaxor1689
[Q&A] I'm teaching a React course and would like to do interactive code examples preferably even embedable in markdown. Any suggestions?
[4:47 PM] cassidoo:Not sure what platform you're using, but Scrimba is pretty good for interactive code, and you could also embed a CodePen or CodeSandbox that way, as well!
[4:48 PM] BaluBabu:[Q&A] I dont know if this is relevant but do you guys have any idea for self hosted object storage solutions we can use to build say a firebase storage clone?
@BaluBabu
[Q&A] I dont know if this is relevant but do you guys have any idea for self hosted object storage solutions we can use to build say a firebase storage clone?

[4:49 PM] jlengstorf:I'm a fan of Jamstack (I know, what a surprise!) because you don't have to deal with servers or any kind of deployment ‚Äî you can build locally with Netlify Dev & the CLI (https://ntl.fyi/dev), then deploy it by pushing to GitHub. I like this because it lets you focus on one area of expertise instead of requiring you to learn lots of things at once

[4:49 PM] xoldyckk:What does react have that solid js doesn't?
@xoldyckk
What does react have that solid js doesn't?
[4:49 PM] cassidoo:Mostly age, experience, and a large community. It seems like you can do quite a bit with Solid, from what I've seen!
[4:50 PM] Eterneon:Do you have any suggested full stack learning materials/courses for a beginner? Like the whole shi-bang! I‚Äôm having trouble stringing together front end and back end from separate resources.
[4:50 PM] syncerax:[Q&A][jamstack] Are there some use cases that you think Jamstack isn't mature enough to handle yet?
@Eterneon
Do you have any suggested full stack learning materials/courses for a beginner? Like the whole shi-bang! I‚Äôm having trouble stringing together front end and back end from separate resources.
[4:50 PM] cassidoo:FreeCodeCamp is great, and I've seen a lot of folks have success with https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend
[4:50 PM] Gabe:We have 10 minutes left! If you haven't asked a question and want to... now is your time
[4:50 PM] Gabe:we'll take 3 more q's please
[4:51 PM] juniornjay:[q&a] does serverless codebases get hard to manage in the long run ? Specially if you have multiple ones in a single project.
@juniornjay
[q&a] does serverless codebases get hard to manage in the long run ? Specially if you have multiple ones in a single project.
[4:51 PM] cassidoo:Depends on how you organize it. I've seen quite a few people break those up into multiple repos for this reason!
[4:51 PM] Haaxor1689:[q&a] Do you think it's still relevant to teach class components in react basics class?
[4:51 PM] Nilando:netlify is dope.
@juniornjay
[q&a] Any advice for non US devs looking for remote roles ?
[4:51 PM] philhawksworth:At Netlify? It me!
Netlify hire globally and we have an ever expanding non-us contingent. I've enjoyed seeing more folks arrive in my timezone and even in my city! (https://netlify.com/careers)

But generally, I think that we are lucky that the market is feeling more and more international and distributed. So there are plenty of opportunities. If you find a role with a company/team in a different time-zone to you, be mindful of finding a culture which is respectful and aware of working across timezones. That has made a huge difference to my quality of life!
[4:51 PM] JasonHoku:What other companies or persons do you follow in tech to get your news/current events?
[4:51 PM] Jamie:Any drawbacks to having a monorepo?
@claudiu
What advice you give to someone without experience in any company and who is self-taught for the last 2 years? Most of the companies want people with experience
[4:51 PM] Mintaka5:build stuff. put it up on github or the like. experience GAINZ!
@Haaxor1689
[q&a] Do you think it's still relevant to teach class components in react basics class?
[4:52 PM] cassidoo:I think they're good to be aware of, but should not be used as a primary way of writing React. I personally don't teach them.
[4:52 PM] Gabe:3 more q's please
@JasonHoku
What other companies or persons do you follow in tech to get your news/current events?
[4:52 PM] cassidoo:@jlengstorf lol
@syncerax
[Q&A][jamstack] Are there some use cases that you think Jamstack isn't mature enough to handle yet?
[4:52 PM] jlengstorf:we're seeing everything from huge SaaS dashboards like Twilio to the kiosks at Popeye's to the apps running in Peloton bikes using the Jamstack, so I don't think there's anything you can't do. at its core, Jamstack means decoupling the frontend and precompiling pages whenever possible ‚Äî that doesn't mean you can't ever use other tools; it's about good defaults, not dogma
@JasonHoku
What other companies or persons do you follow in tech to get your news/current events?
[4:53 PM] jlengstorf:I follow @cassidoo
[4:53 PM] kanerva:What mistake(s) do you see most beginners do?
[4:53 PM] BaluBabu:[Q&A] Redux vs UseContext, which one is better and must be used often?
[4:53 PM] Arkadiusz:Lightning round: useEffect() a source of love or bugs?
@Jamie
Any drawbacks to having a monorepo?
[4:53 PM] cassidoo:Things being very closely intertwined in a monorepo can be fairly difficult to maintain over time. If you build it in a strictly modular way, you'll do well.
@kanerva
What mistake(s) do you see most beginners do?
[4:53 PM] philhawksworth:Not asking enough questions üôÇ
@Arkadiusz
Lightning round: useEffect() a source of love or bugs?
[4:54 PM] cassidoo:Love, especially with subscription-style functions, but also pain and agony if you mess up üòÜ
@BaluBabu
[Q&A] Redux vs UseContext, which one is better and must be used often?
[4:54 PM] jlengstorf:both are great! the "better" option is the one that the team maintaining it is comfortable keeping healthy and iterating on over time
[4:54 PM] xoldyckk:Sql vs query builder vs orms
[4:54 PM] Gabe:we'll take 3 more questions please
[4:55 PM] BaluBabu:Any cool projects out there that interest you guys ?
[4:55 PM] Haaxor1689:Which form lib you prefer overall? Formik/final-form/hook-form/other?
[4:55 PM] Edaz:sql or graphqL?
[4:56 PM] BaluBabu:What would you consider is the next step for a dev working with React for 4+ years ?
@BaluBabu
Any cool projects out there that interest you guys ?
[4:56 PM] cassidoo:I mentioned Supabase earlier, I think the fact that it's open source is so cool!
@Edaz
sql or graphqL?
[4:56 PM] philhawksworth:REST!!! üòú
@xoldyckk
Sql vs query builder vs orms
[4:56 PM] jlengstorf:I like ORMs for large teams. I think there's value in matching the level of effort to set something up vs. the amount of time it's expected to live
@cassidoo
I mentioned Supabase earlier, I think the fact that it's open source is so cool!
[4:56 PM] philhawksworth:I'm a fan
@Haaxor1689
Which form lib you prefer overall? Formik/final-form/hook-form/other?
[4:56 PM] cassidoo:Reach UI components to make forms is my favorite, personally!
@Haaxor1689
Which form lib you prefer overall? Formik/final-form/hook-form/other?
[4:56 PM] jlengstorf:real talk: I love plain ol' forms with the built-in FormData API
@BaluBabu
What would you consider is the next step for a dev working with React for 4+ years ?
[4:57 PM] cassidoo:Understanding how to build reusable libraries is difficult and worth knowing!
@jlengstorf
I like ORMs for large teams. I think there's value in matching the level of effort to set something up vs. the amount of time it's expected to live
[4:57 PM] xoldyckk:How about from a freelancer's perspective?
[4:57 PM] Gabe:2 final questions! we only have 3 minutes left
[4:57 PM] Arkadiusz:MUI or AntDesign?
@xoldyckk
How about from a freelancer's perspective?
[4:57 PM] jlengstorf:do you reuse that code between projects? do you need to maintain it? are the projects temporary launches (like a marketing campaign) or app platforms? all of that factors into my decisions about architecture
[4:57 PM] Haaxor1689:What would you say are topics/concepts junior devs struggle the most with?
@Edaz
sql or graphqL?
[4:58 PM] philhawksworth:Answering this with another answer to the question about interesting serverless functions usage:
https://canyoutell.me/sql-or-graphqL
@Haaxor1689
What would you say are topics/concepts junior devs struggle the most with?
[4:59 PM] jlengstorf:the initial hurdle of "thinking in code" is a big one. anything that doesn't have a clear analogy in real life. abstract logic is really hard!
