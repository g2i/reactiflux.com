# Experience roles

We have self-selectable roles indicating experience, intended to help our members better understand who they're speaking with. Please don't use these for jokes.

# Participation rewards

We have certain expectations for how members of the communities who have been distinguished with roles behave in the server. If you feel these expectations are not being met, Reactiflux staff would appreciate you reaching out. You can find information about how to do so on our [contact page](/contact).

## <span style="color: #e74c3c">█ Admins</span>

Our staff, (moderators and admins) share responsibility for day-to-day operation of the server, as members who have earned trust over years to safeguard Reactiflux. Our admins are selected from moderators who have gone above and beyond keeping the community operating, completing a project that expanded what the community is. These might a community program like an event series, or a technical project like a bot or major website contribution.

## <span style="color: #e67e22">█ Moderators</span>

Our moderators are tasked with keeping the server on the right course. They're our trusted stewards of server culture, trusted to enforce the code of conduct and oversee server governance. We select these from Star Helpers who have demonstrated a consistently even keel and a history of defusing unhealthy conflicts.

## <span style="color: #f1c40f">█ Star Helpers</span>

Every quarter, we review the participation in the server for our most active, most selfless members offering their knowledge to folks asking for help. These members are all outstanding developers who have earned a rare achievement; of the thousands of active posters in Reactiflux, we recognize between 15 and 30 Star Helpers per quarter, and only around 40 per year.

We evaluate by a combination of quantitative factors (message count and channels participated in) and qualitative factors (manual review by a human of members who cross the quantitative threshold). As trusted, highly engaged members of the community, these members are granted limited moderation access to delete messages and timeout members. Any action they take is tracked and reviewed by admins and moderators.

## <span style="color: #9b59b6">█ MVPs</span>

MVPs are members who made an early impact in the server, without them the server would not be what it is.

### <span style="color: #b182cf">█ MVP Emeritus</span>

These people were added to the MVP role before we formalized a process for how it would be applied.
