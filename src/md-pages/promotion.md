_(Adapted from the [Rands Leadership Slack code of conduct](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#not-for-profit-mostly))_

This is a community, not a free audience. This is not a place for prominent commercial activities such as recruiting, lead generation, marketing, market research, or other solicitation, except in channels dedicated to that purpose. **If you join this community to take value rather than contribute, the community will quickly react as though you are an intruder.** As this community grows, our tolerance for unsolicited commercial behavior decreases.

If you have a body of content you'd like to promote, our recommended way of doing so is to be an active and positive member of the server. If someone has a question that you've created an external answer to, we'd love if you share it! While apparent commercial behavior is easy to identify, non-obvious commercial behavior is a grey area. In general, if you are wondering if a post is commercially appropriate, our guidelines are that you:

- Ask permission from the channel before posting a message that might be considered commercial, stating clear intent for the post, and,
- Listen to the response of your peers in the channel and act accordingly.

If, after engaging with the community, you are still wondering if a specific message is commercial or not, please ask in one of the channels dedicated to helping find their way in this community, such as contacting the admins [by email](mailto:hello@reactiflux.com) or [on our contact page](/contact). To help determine if what you want to share is an advertisement, here are some questions to help inform your decision:

You should be able to answer "yes" to:

- Did you make it yourself, or contribute to its creation?
- Is it relevant to our members?
- Can people benefit without paying?

And "no" to:

- Are you announcing an announcement?
- Are you soliciting [spec work](https://www.nospec.com/)?
- Are you running a giveaway, airdrop, or other contest?
- Are you directly asking people to subscribe for updates?
- Do people need to pay to benefit from what you're sharing?

We grant more leeway to members who have been active participants in the community, as well. If you're unsure, reach out to discuss.

We want the majority of what's shared to be created by genuine members of Reactiflux. Active members ask questions, share knowledge, or simply follow along with the chat (make sure to drop a note in #introductions!).

# Promotion channels

## [#q-and-a](https://discord.gg/MbKwYuq)

Reactiflux sometimes hosts conversations with prominent members of the community, and those working on interesting projects in the web development industry. If you're interested in participating, contact the moderators at [hello@reactiflux.com](mailto:hello@reactiflux.com).

## [#job-board](https://discord.gg/R942bNb)

Our job board is our most strictly moderated channel. Posts should follow the rules and recommendataions in the channel description so they can be properly displayed and searched on our [jobs page](/jobs/). If you're acting as a third-party recruiter, please [contact the moderators before posting](/contact).

Posts must start with `[FORHIRE]` or `[HIRING]`. Lead with the location of the position and include `LOCAL`, `REMOTE`, `INTERN`, `VISA`, and keep the message reasonably formatted & a reasonable length — 1-2 paragraphs, please. Provide a means for applicants to contact you. e.g.:

<details open>
<summary>Global remote position</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>[HIRING]</p>

<p>Senior React Engineer - [REMOTE]: $min - $max</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>

Jobs are full-time salaried positions, or part- or full-time contract roles. We don't allow small gigs, "pay for help" schemes, equity-only compensation, [spec work](https://www.nospec.com/), or other types of uncompensated labor. We do not have a channel for finding project collaborators.

### Small gigs

We have a hard ban on work that too small to be considered contract work. A general rule of thumb here is whether the work would take less than a week to complete, could be completed in a single call, or could be compared to a single tutoring session. We do permit, but don't encourage, our members to arrange [paid tutoring relationships, within our guidelines](#paid-help-and-tutoring).

## [#events](https://discord.gg/RYVBdtY)

Announcing an upcoming conference or discussing an ongoing conference are both encouraged here. In general, we'd prefer conferences limit their announcements to 1 per major milestone. When it's announced, near registration deadlines, and when it's about to happen would be appropriate.

### Events, vlogs, and periodic content

If you're hosting a conference, livestreamed event, Q&A session or similar, you're welcome to share in #events.

## [#i-wrote-this](https://discord.gg/xtmDRsShgm)

Share your own writing here. This is mainly intended to be a showcase for personal writing and content produced by individuals, livestreams and other educational content may also be shared here. Episodic content may only be shared once every 2 weeks.

### Paid content

Books, courses, and other bodies of work behind a pay wall should not be shared, except in response to another member. We encourage recommending materials that will help members advance, but strongly prefer it resemble networking rather than advertising.

### Surveys

Reactiflux only allows surveys from private organizations if they're shared by an active member of the community. Surveys may be posted if the results will be public or used for academic purposes, and should only be shared once. Fair warning: most surveys get relatively low uptake, they just aren't of interest to many in the community.

### Vlogs, streams, and other serialized content

If you're sharing episodic content like a video series, livestream, or podcast, please refrain from promoting each new episode — we'd prefer that you share the show/channel/etc itself. For long-running shows we ask that you only promote it every 2 weeks at most.

## [#i-built-this](https://discord.gg/GaCSDfm)

New side projects, libraries, or other works you want to show off. This is predominantly meant as a showcase for individuals, but may be used for launch announcements of indie works.

# Specific types of promotion

## Outside communities

Reactiflux generally does not allow external communities to be promoted. If another server would better serve someone asking a question (for example, asking a detailed python question in #general-tech), then members are welcome to share server invites. Announcements or promotions of communities must be of obvious interest to the majority of the Reactiflux community.

## Paid help and tutoring

Reactiflux is a community of developers helping each other out, but sometimes the amount of help someone is seeking may become a significant time investment for the person helping them. In circumstances like this, Reactiflux supports our members reaching out to discuss private tutoring. This is only something we allow for members who are active in the main purpose of the server; members with low or infrequent activity are not allowed to make offers like this. Members should post publicly to ask permission to DM about tutoring, but discussion of the specific arrangements (frequency, compensation, etc) should be done in private. Reactiflux staff are not able to mediate disputes that arise from arrangements like this, and members who participate in this way are subjected to increased moderator scrutiny.
