title: Self Promotion
---

Reactiflux's members do lots of cool stuff, and we'd love for you to share what you've done!

We have 2 channels where self-promotion is expected. We ask that you share it only once, unless there's a significant milestone or it's relevant to someone's question.

## [#i-made-this](https://discord.gg/GaCSDfm)

New side projects, libraries, or other works you want to show off. This is predominantly meant as a showcase for individuals.

## [#news-and-links](https://discord.gg/TEYnXKw)

If you want to share an announcement of a new blog post, product, feature, or other effort, then this is the most appropriate channel. Reactiflux does not generally allow advertising, however.

### Self promotion vs advertising

The line here can be thin. Reactiflux is a community, not a marketing channel. To help determine if what you want to share is an announcement, here are some questions to help you decide.

You should be able to answer "yes" to:

- Did you make it yourself or help make it?
- Does it use or discuss React?

And "no" to:

- Are you announcing an announcement?
- Are you soliciting [spec work](https://www.nospec.com/)?
- Are you running a giveaway or contest?
- Are you directly asking people to subscribe for updates?
- Do people need to pay to benefit from what you're sharing?

We grant more leeway to members who have been active participants in the community, as well. If you're unsure, please post in #reactiflux-admin or direct message any of the admins with your intended message, and we can help clarify.

We want the majority of what's shared to be created by genuine members of Reactiflux. That could be asking questions, sharing knowledge, or simply following along with the chat (drop a note in #introductions!).
